## Project Purpose
This project is a full-featured e-commerce admin panel designed to manage products, orders, customers, and analytics for an online store. It provides a modern, responsive UI and comprehensive CRUD operations for efficient business management.

## Approach
The project was approached by first outlining the core requirements for an admin dashboard, including product, order, customer, and analytics management. The UI was designed using glassmorphism and gradients for a modern look. Development was done in a modular fashion, with reusable components and hooks for state and theme management. Features were implemented incrementally, with regular testing and refinement.

## Time Taken
- Total development time: **6 hours**

## Tech Stack Used
- **React 18** (with TypeScript)
- **Vite** (for fast development/build)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **shadcn/ui** (UI components)
- **Lucide React** (icons)
- **Chart.js** & **react-chartjs-2** (charts)
